# Canonical System Prompt Template (DO NOT EDIT)

This file defines the exact system prompt scaffold.
Any change requires an explicit architectural decision.

[paste the full canonical system prompt here verbatim]

Pinned lines:

- Tone: {{tone}}
- Pace: {{pacing}}
- Overall, responses should feel {{tone_description}} and move at a {{pacing_description}} pace.
